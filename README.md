Welcome to Sketchware Pro! Here you'll find the source code of many classes in Sketchware Pro and, most importantly, the place to contribute to Sketchware Pro.

## Building the App
To build the app, you must use Gradle. It's highly recommended to use Android Studio for the best experience.

There are two build variants with different features:

- `minApi26:` This variant supports exporting AABs from projects and compiling Java 1.8, 1.9, 10, and 11 code. However, it only works on Android 8.0 (O) and above.
- `minApi21:` This variant can't produce AABs from projects and can only compile Java 1.7 code, but it supports Android 5 and above.

To select the appropriate build variant in Android Studio, use the Build Variants tab or use the appropriate Gradle build command.

| Class           | Role                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `a.a.a.ProjectBuilder`      | Helper for compiling an entire project       |
| `a.a.a.Ix`      | Responsible for generating AndroidManifest.xml |
| `a.a.a.Jx`      | Generates source code of activities          |
| `a.a.a.Lx`      | Generates source code of components, such as listeners, etc. |
| `a.a.a.Ox`      | Responsible for generating XML files of layouts |
| `a.a.a.qq`      | Registry of built-in libraries' dependencies |
| `a.a.a.tq`      | Responsible for the compiling dialog's quizzes |
| `a.a.a.yq`      | Organizes Sketchware projects' file paths    |

> You can also check the `mod` package, which contains the majority of contributors' changes.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to Sketchware Pro, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make changes in your forked repository.
3. Test out those changes.
4. Create a pull request in this repository.
5. Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository members and merged if accepted.

We welcome contributions of any size, whether they are major features or bug fixes, but please note that all contributions will be thoroughly reviewed.

### What Changes We're Unlikely to Accept

Most changes related to the user interface (components that already exist in vanilla Sketchware) are unlikely to be accepted. If something design-related gets changed, ideally the whole app should follow the new style too, which is challenging, especially for mods.
> [!NOTE]
> In the meantime, we don't accept UI changes in the main branch, but we do in the [redesign branch](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/tree/material-redesign) since we're actively working on a material design version of Sketchware Pro.

### Commit Message

When you make changes to one or more files, you need to commit those changes with a commit message. Here are some guidelines:

- Keep the commit message short and detailed.
- Use one of these commit types as a prefix:
  - `feat:` for a feature, possibly improving something already existing.
  - `fix:` for a fix, such as a bug fix.
  - `style:` for features and updates related to styling.
  - `refactor:` for refactoring a specific section of the codebase.
  - `test:` for everything related to testing.
  - `docs:` for everything related to documentation.
  - `chore:` for code maintenance (you can also use emojis to represent commit types).

Examples:
- `feat: Speed up compiling with new technique`
- `fix: Fix crash during launch on certain phones`
- `refactor: Reformat code in File.java`

## Disclaimer

This mod was not created for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; quite the opposite, actually. It was made to keep Sketchware alive by the community for the community. Please use it at your own discretion and consider becoming a Patreon backer to support the developers. Unfortunately, other ways to support them are not working anymore, so Patreon is the only available option currently. You can find their Patreon page [here](https://www.patreon.com/sketchware).

We do NOT permit publishing Sketchware Pro as it is, or with modifications, on Play Store or on any other app store. Keep in mind that this project is still a mod. Unauthorized modding of apps is considered illegal and we discourage such behavior.

We love Sketchware very much and are grateful to Sketchware's developers for creating such an amazing app. However, we haven't received updates for a long time. That's why we decided to keep Sketchware alive by creating this mod, and it's completely free. We don't demand any money :)
